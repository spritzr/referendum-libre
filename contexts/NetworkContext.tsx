/**
 * Active-network context.
 *
 * - The selected network (`testnet` | `mainnet`) is persisted to AsyncStorage
 *   under NETWORK_STORAGE_KEY so it survives app restarts.
 * - On boot we render with DEFAULT_NETWORK first and then hydrate from storage
 *   in an effect — the `hydrated` flag lets screens that *only* render after
 *   network is known (e.g. home screen that fires RPC calls in useEffect)
 *   wait until persistence has resolved. Most call sites can ignore it; the
 *   default value is correct for first installs.
 * - Changing the network mid-session invalidates the BJJ-identity / proposal
 *   cache stored against the previous network. We don't wipe those caches
 *   here (cheap to refetch + the user expects re-init), but consumers should
 *   re-create their Rarime/FreedomTool instances when `network` changes.
 *   See voting-flow.tsx: the SDK refs are nulled out on network change so the
 *   next entry into Step 7 re-initialises against the new addresses.
