// One player, one codec.
//
// The voting flow used to run six VideoPlayers — one per illustrated step —
// which meant up to four concurrent ExoPlayer/MediaCodec instances on Android
// through the ±1 sliding window. That many hardware decoders in flight is a
// documented stressor for the vendor-codec use-after-free that crashes media3
// in SampleDataQueue.readData -> DirectByteBuffer.put -> memcpy, and the
// workaround at the time (static PNG posters on Android) cost the animation
// entirely on those steps.
//
// Those step clips were all short silent loops of a flat-shaded illustration —
// exactly the content GIF encodes well — so they now ship as animated GIFs
// rendered through react-native's Image (Fresco animates them on Android via
// expo.gif.enabled=true in gradle.properties; iOS animates them natively).
// That restores motion on Android *and* removes the codecs.
//
// The Step 4 intro is the one genuine video: full-bleed, six seconds, with a
// skip affordance. It keeps a real player — and it is now the only one, so the
// concurrent-codec pressure that caused the crash is gone by construction.
