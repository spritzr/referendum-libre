# Contributing to Referendum Libre

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Expo SDK 54 (local CLI via `npx expo` — no global install)
- iOS: Xcode 16+, CocoaPods
- Android: Android Studio, NDK 27.1.12297006

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/referendum-libre/referendum-libre-react-native.git
cd referendum-libre-react-native

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate native projects
npx expo prebuild

# Start development
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```

### Video asset encoding

Voting-flow videos must be Android-safe MP4s: H.264 **Constrained Baseline**, `yuv420p`, no B-frames, with the MP4 metadata moved to the front for progressive loading. This lighter Android encoding also plays on iOS, so do **not** keep separate iOS Main/High-profile variants unless there is a proven platform-specific issue.

On Linux, install `ffmpeg` and encode each source clip like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -an \
  -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2,format=yuv420p" \
  -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -x264-params "bframes=0:ref=1" \
  -crf 23 -preset slow -movflags +faststart \
  assets/videos/videoN.mp4
```

Then verify the result before committing:

```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
  -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,pix_fmt,has_b_frames \
  -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 assets/videos/videoN.mp4
```

Expected values are `codec_name=h264`, `profile=Constrained Baseline`, `pix_fmt=yuv420p`, and `has_b_frames=0`.

## Code Style

### Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting. Run before committing:

```bash
npm run format
```

### Linting

We use ESLint for code quality. Check for issues with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript - avoid `any` types when possible
- Define interfaces for component props
- Use proper type imports

## Git Workflow

### Branching model

We use a two-branch GitFlow-lite:

- **`develop`** — integration branch. All feature work, bug fixes, refactors,
  and docs go here. The weekly Android build (debug-signed APK) runs off
  this branch.
- **`master`** — release branch. Updated only by maintainers, who merge
  `develop` into `master` when a cut is ready. Signed-release APKs are
  built from tags on `master`.

```
   feature/foo ──┐
                 ├──► develop ──(maintainer merge)──► master ──(tag v1.4)──► signed APK
   fix/bar ─────┘                  │                              │
                                   ▼                              ▼
                          weekly debug APK              GitHub Release w/ SHA-256
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-biometric-auth`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/nfc-timeout-error`)
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(voting): add confirmation step`
- `fix(nfc): handle timeout on slow devices`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository (or branch directly if you have write access)
2. Create a feature branch off **`develop`**: `git checkout develop && git pull && git checkout -b feature/<short-name>`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm test`, and `npx tsc --noEmit`
5. Test on both iOS and Android if possible
6. Open a PR **against `develop`**, not `master`. PRs targeting `master`
   will be redirected — only maintainers merge into `master`.

### Cutting a release (maintainers only)

Releases are gated to `master` so the signed-APK workflow can't be tricked
into shipping unreviewed code from a feature branch. The workflow
verifies that the tag's commit is an ancestor of `origin/master` and
refuses to run otherwise.

1. Merge `develop` into `master`:
   ```
   git checkout master && git pull
   git merge --no-ff develop
   git push origin master
   ```
2. Tag the release commit on `master`:
   ```
   git tag -a v1.4 -m "Referendum Libre v1.4"
   git push origin v1.4
   ```
   Tag names must match `v[0-9]*` (e.g. `v1.4`, `v1.4.1`, `v2.0-beta1`).
3. The `Android Release (signed APK)` workflow runs automatically. When it
   finishes, the signed APK + SHA-256 + `apksigner verify` output are
   attached to a GitHub Release named after the tag.
4. Bump `app.config.ts` `version` on `develop` to the next planned version
   so subsequent nightlies don't collide with the just-released tag.

The one-time signing-keystore setup (`keytool` recipe + required GitHub
secrets) is documented in the header of
`.github/workflows/android-release.yml`.
