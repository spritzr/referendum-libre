/**
 * On-chain confirmation of a submitted vote.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The Rarimo vote relayer (`/v2/vote`) returns a tx hash the moment it
 * *broadcasts* the transaction — NOT when the tx is mined. A transaction that
 * later reverts on-chain (e.g. an identity registered after the proposal's
 * `identityCreationTimestampUpperBound`, a failed Groth16 verification, or a
 * used nullifier) still has a valid hash and decodable `vote(...)` calldata.
 *
 * Treating "relayer accepted" or "tx exists" as "vote counted" is the bug this
 * module fixes: both the post-vote success screen and the verifier tab must
 * gate on the on-chain receipt's `status === 1`. A reverted tx
 * (`status === 0`) means the vote was NOT registered and must surface as an
 * error, not a green success.

 * Poll the voting RPC for the tx receipt until it is mined (status known) or

 *   'success'  — mined, status 1 (vote counted)
 *   'reverted' — mined, status 0 (vote NOT counted)
 *   'pending'  — still not mined when the timeout elapsed
 *
 * Transient RPC errors during polling are swallowed and treated as 'pending'
 * so a flaky read doesn't masquerade as a revert.
